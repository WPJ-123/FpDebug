GNU MPFR (for GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliably)

GNU MPFR is used by FpDebug to perform the side-by-side computation in higher precision.
MPFR hat to be adjusted because Valgrind does not provide the full C library to its tools.

1. Download MPFR in version 3.0.0:
	http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-3.0.0/
2. Apply the patch in the main directory:
	patch -p1 -i mpfr-3.0.0.patch
3. Copy src/valgrind_additions.c into the src folder of MPFR.
4. Build and install MPFR
	See the INSTALL file in the main directory of MPFR.
	Note that the target directory for the MPFR installation can be specified. This is useful
	if MPFR is needed by other programs on your machine as the modified versions won't work with them.
