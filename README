FpDebug is a heavyweight Valgrind tool for detecting floating-point accuracy problems.

The tool uses MPFR for its analysis. Because MPFR is run with the tool on top of Valgrind, it has only access to the partial C library provided by Valgrind. Thus, a patch for MPFR is provided that adjusts it to run on top of Valgrind. As GMP is used by MFPR, a patch for GMP is also  provided.

Further information is provided in the HOWTO files in the subdirectories.
