GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library)

GNU MPFR requires GMP and MPFR is used by FpDebug to perform the side-by-side computation in 
higher precision. GMP hat to be adjusted because Valgrind does not provide the full C library
to its tools.

1. Download GMP in version 5.0.1:
	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/
2. Apply the patch in the main directory:
	patch -p1 -i gmp-5.0.1.patch
3. Build and install GMP
	See the INSTALL file in the main directory of GMP.
	Note that the target directory for the GMP installation can be specified. This is useful
	if GMP is needed by other programs on your machine as the modified versions won't work with them.
